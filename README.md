WeatherPy & VacationPy - use citipy Python Library and OpenWeatherMap API to create representative models of weather across cities
In WeatherPy, random geographic coordinates are generated and the following data is gathered, city, latitude, longitude, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, country, and date.
A series of scatter plots were generated showing the relationship between latitude and temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.
Scatter plots and linear regression is also calculated for the northern and southern hemisphere comparing the same factors as above.

In VacationPy, map visualizations to plan a future vacation are made through Geoapify API and the geoViews Python Library.
A dataframe with ideal conditions for a vacation spot is produced, showing locations that meet the criteria.
A dataframe and map visualization that includes hotel data is also included. It shows the first hotel located within 10000 meters from the plotted city, along with the country.
